# go-finger

go-finger is a [finger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_protocol)
library written in Go. This contains both a client and server implementation.

The [finger protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1288) is an extremely
simple TCP protocol. It can be implemented without a library cleanly in only
a few dozen lines of code but a library helps ensure correctness and handles
RFC-compliant request parsing automatically.

## Example

```go
import "github.com/mitchellh/go-finger"
```

### Server

```go
go finger.Serve(finger.HandlerFunc(func(ctx context.Context, w io.Writer, q *finger.Query) {
	w.Write([]byte(fmt.Sprintf("Hello %q", q.Username)))
}))
```

You can also set more detailed configurations by creating a `Server`
structure directly. The top-level `Serve` function sets reasonable defaults.
